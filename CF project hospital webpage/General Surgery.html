<h1><b>General Surgery:</b></h1>
<p class="lead"><strong>General surgery is a medical discipline that involves performing various types of surgical procedures to treat a broad range of health problems and diseases.<br>

In general surgery, the surgeon is expected to perform both pre- and post-operative care and management other than the surgery itself. General surgeons can diagnose several types of diseases, especially those that are related to the abdomen and the organs connected to it. These include bile ducts, liver, pancreas, spleen, appendix, small and large intestine, rectum, and the stomach. The surgeon may also operate the thoracic region, glands in the thyroids, and hernias. To a certain extent, general surgeons are also responsible for procedures performed on the skin and the breast.<br>

General surgeons are also expected to treat burn patients. Hence, aside from hospitals, they can also be found in trauma centers and emergency departments.<br>

With so many sub-specialties under surgery, people do often get confused with general surgery and cranial, cardiovascular, etc. The main difference is the kind of knowledge that general surgeons gain during training. While general surgeons learn to treat several types of diseases, they receive core knowledge. Anything that requires a more comprehensive or specific knowledge should be passed on to a specific surgeon or specialist. For example, a general surgeon can operate the vascular regions except for the heart, which should be managed by a cardiovascular surgeon.<br>

General surgeons go through rigorous training and education before they are allowed to practice. They spend at least two years to complete prerequisite courses before they proceed to medical school, which usually take four years. Then, they complete a five-year residency program in any accredited hospital to specialize in surgery. Depending on the program, the general surgeon should be able to perform at least a thousand surgeries. After that, they can qualify for a board certification. They also need to obtain a medical license from the state where they wish to practice. In addition, they are required to go through several continuing education programs. If the surgeons wish to specialize in a surgical field, they may spend at least three years for further training.<br></strong></p>
